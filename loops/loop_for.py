# FOR 游댅

# 1) counting loops  - for  - cycles repeated a certain number of times
# 2) conditional loops - while  - cycles that repeat until a specific event occurs

# 游릮 The for loop works great if we know in advance how many iterations we need to do.

# for i in range(10):
#     print("hello")

# for loop_variable_name in range(number_of_repetitions):
# code block OR body of the loop

# for i in range(3):
#     num = int(input())
#     print("The square:", num * num)

# print("Loop is over")

# 游댯

# print("A")
# print("B")

# for i in range(5):
#     print("C")
#     print("D")

# print("E")

# 游릭

# print("A")
# print("B")

# for i in range(5):
#     print("C")

# for i in range(5):
#     print("D")

# print("E")

# Executing the body of a loop once is called a loop iteration.
