# TO START i from 0:

# for i in range(10):
#     print(i + 1, "-- Hello")

# var  of loops usually call : i, j, k

# There are situations when a loop variable is not used in the body of the loop. In this case, instead of giving it a name, we can specify the underscore character _ :

# for _ in range(5):
#     print("Python - awesome!")

# REMEMBER

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

for i in range(5):
    print(i + 1)
