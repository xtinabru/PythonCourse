# Built in function means that the programmer doesn't see its realization.

# They are:
# 👽
# print()
# input()
# int()
# float()

# Functions min() and max() ⭐️

# doesn't matter how many arguments
# the main point is that all of them should support the comparison operation, for example: float and int
# but float and str  - do not support

# a = max(3, 8, -3, 12, 9)
# b = min(3, 8, -3, 12, 9)
# c = max(3.14, 2.17, 9.8)
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)

# Functions abs() ⭐️

# The absolute value or modulus

# the abs of "+" number = number, if n > 0
# the abs of "-" number = n, if n < 0
# the abs of "0" = 0, if n = 0

# print(abs(10))
# print(abs(-7))
# print(abs(0))
# print(abs(-17.67))

# max(), min(), abs() work with BOTH: int and float numbers
