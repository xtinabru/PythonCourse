# Strings 🎀

# examples:
# s1 = 'Python rocks!'
# s2 = "Python rocks!"

# by default input() reads string

# s = input()  # переменная s имеет строковый тип str

# for empty string:
# s1 = ""
# s2 = " "  📍they are different

# Length 📏

# s1 = "abcdef"
# length1 = len(s1)
# print(length1)

# Numbers to str 📈

# num1 = 1777
# num2 = 17.77
# s1 = str(num1)
# s2 = str(num2)

# Concatenation 📎

# s1 = "ab" + "bc"
# s2 = "bc" + "ab"
# s3 = s1 + s2 + "!!"
# print(s1)
# print(s2)
# print(s3)

# print("a", "b", "c", sep="*", end="!")
# print()  # new line
# print("a" + "*" + "b" + "*" + "c" + "!")

# Division str to num ⚒

# s = "Hi" * 4
# print(s)
# print("-" * 75)

# STR CAN NOT BE MULT TO STR❗️
